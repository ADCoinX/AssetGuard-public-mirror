## 🔍 Overview
**AssetGuard** validates tokens, coins, and NFTs across multiple chains using AI-powered risk scoring.

## 🛡 Security-first Design
- **Stateless**: No PII stored; all processing done in-memory.
- **Aggregate Logging Only**: Counts & metrics, no wallet or asset addresses stored.
- **Multi-layer Security**:
  - TLS enforced
  - Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)
  - CORS allowlist
  - Rate limiting + WAF
